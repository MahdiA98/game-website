# Game Website
Built in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP using Visual Studio Code.

Developed as part of my summative assignment, for the 'Web Applications & Databases' module.

## Description
A simple website that incorporates the basics of HTML & CSS (with a little JavaScript and PHP implemented too). Allows the user to play a game designed using the Canvas API. Login functionalities are also included, with the use of the browser's local  and session storage. 

It consists of the following pages:
* Home 
* About 
* Game 
* Hi-scores
* Contact

Both the Home and About page, are front-end focused, with introductory text and instructions for the game, provided to the user.

Within the Game page, the user is able to play a basic arcade style shooter. With a total of 3 lives, the aim of the game is to score as many points as possible, until all lives are lost. The player maneuvers the green tank, using the arrow keys and shoots incoming enemy tanks, with the spacebar. If a bullet manages to hit one of the enemy tanks, the score is incremented. In the event that the user collides with an enemy tank, they lose a life and are reset in the default position. A single enemy tank is continuously spawned until the end game condition is met. When said condition is reached, a window alert appears with a 'GAME OVER' text. Clicking on the OK button, resets the entire game.

## How to use
Navigate the pages using the subheading buttons located under the header banner. 

To play the game, proceed to the Game page and initiate it by clicking on START button.

In order to register a new user, go to the accounts page and click on the Register button. When complete, or the user has an exisiting account, they are able to login with the correct credentials.  

## Technology
HTML and CSS was used to create the foundation and styling of the websites.
JavaScript was used for the database aspects, including the login and registration, as well as the high scores. 
PHP was used to minimise code repetition and increase modularity. This was mainly applied for the head and footer tags, as they remained constant throughout each subsequent page.
