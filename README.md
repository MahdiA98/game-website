## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
This project was developed as part of my assignment in the 'Web Applications & Databases' module. Project goals included developing a simple website and game, that incorporates the basics of HTML/CSS and introductory concepts to JavaScript and PHP.

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>
User is able to play the game by initiating it with the START button. The goal is to eliminate as many of the enemy tanks as possible, before you lose all 3 lives. Controls include arrow keys to maneuver player's tank and spacebar to shoot missiles. 

Login functionalities are also provided, with the use of the browser's local and session storage. User simply navigates to the appropriate page, and are able to register or login with their existing credentials.
